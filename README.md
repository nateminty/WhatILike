# WhatILike Database
WhatILike database project written by Nate Mintz

*WIL* is a database of people's names and their favorite things. I used famous people to initially fill up the DB, but you can just delete the contents of **til.txt** to empty the DB.

*See til.txt for database*

**If til.txt already exists, it *MUST* be placed on the Desktop**

**If til.txt does not already exist, it will be created on the first run-through and placed on the Desktop**

**The fonts and images should be downloaded and placed in the same folder *WhatILike.java* is located in**
